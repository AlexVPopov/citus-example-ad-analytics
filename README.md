## Schema Diagram

We're distributing only the part of our dataset that we expect to take significant amounts of space, specifically
`ads`, `clicks` and `impressions` (marked with ðŸ¦„).

We use `ad_id` as the common shard key for the hash distribution, in order to have data for a specific ad colocated on one shard.

## Deploying

1. Signup for a Citus Cloud account: https://console.citusdata.com/users/sign_up
2. Provision a new formation of servers (they are billed hourly), a small one will suffice for testing
3. On the formation detail page, wait until the cluster is configured, then click *Show Full URL* and copy it to your clipboard
4. [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/citusdata/citus-example-ad-analytics) and enter the URL from your clipboard as DATABASE_URL
5. Run `heroku run rake db:migrate` followed by `heroku run:detached rake test_data:load_bulk` (the latter will run in the background and take a while, generating data for testing)
