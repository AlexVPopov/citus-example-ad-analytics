## Schema Diagram

We're distributing only the part of our dataset that we expect to take significant amounts of space, specifically
`ads`, `clicks` and `impressions` (marked with ðŸ¦„).

We use `ad_id` as the common shard key for the hash distribution, in order to have data for a specific ad colocated on one shard.
